			<h2>
				Leyburn - Heart of Wensleydale
			</h2>
			<p>
				Clyde House is well situated on the main street just off the market place, on the A684 between Bedale and Hawes
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.welcometoleyburn.co.uk/" target=_blank>Leyburn</a> is a busy market town in mid-Wensleydale.
				There is a weekly general market on Fridays and a livestock market on Wednesday and Friday each week.
				<a href="http://www.tennants.co.uk/" target=_blank>Tennants</a>, the largest auction house in the country, is
				located just outside the town. <a href="http://www.dalesfestivaloffood.org/" target=_blank>
				The Dales Festival of Food and Drink</a> is held each year over the second weekend in June, highlighting
				local produce from the surrounding area. <a href="http://www.wensleydaleshow.org.uk/" target=_blank>The Wensleydale
				Show</a>, held on August Bank Holiday Saturday, has livestock classes and displays of local handicrafts and horticulture.
				<a href="http://www.swaledale-festival.org.uk/" target=_blank>The Swaledale festival</a> at the end of May and beginning
				of June incorporates Leyburn and Middleham, featuring music and theatrical events.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.wensleydalerail.com" target=_blank>The Wensleydale Railway</a> has a regular summer
				service from Leeming Bar to Redmire (for Castle Bolton) passing through Leyburn. A very popular 1940’s weekend is held
				at the end of July, as well as featuring special events throughout the year.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are several castles very close to Leyburn;  <a href="http://www.boltoncastle.co.uk/metadot/index.pl" target=_blank>
				Castle Bolton</a> where Mary Queen of Scot’s was imprisoned and attempted to escape to Leyburn.  
				<a href="http://www.middlehamonline.com/Middleham%20Castle.htm" target=_blank>Middleham Castle</a> was the former home of Richard III
				and boasts one of the largest keeps in England. On entry to the town from Leyburn, there is a suspension bridge which was
				one of the first built in 1829.  <a href="http://www.middlehamonline.com/" target=_blank>Middleham</a> is also
				well known for its large selection of racing stables, which open their yards to visitors on Easter Monday only each year.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.jervaulxabbey.com/home.php" target=_blank>Jervaulx Abbey</a>, which is only six miles from Leyburn,
				is the second largest privately owned Abbey in the United Kingdom. Originally founded in 1156 by Cistercian monks, the
				Abbey was destroyed in the 1530’s during the dissolution of the	monasteries. It was here, that the original Wensleydale
				cheese was first made - it is now produced at the <a href="http://www.wensleydale.co.uk/" target=_blank>Wensleydale
				Creamery</a> in Hawes.
			</p>
